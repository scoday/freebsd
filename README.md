## Background
This is a grassroots effort to try and make FreeBSD more enterprise ready. There needs to be a group to promote and support FreeBSD at the level that other OSes are. Just a thought.

## KumoBSD
This project is just what it sounds like, it can be found over [here](https://github.com/scoday/freebsd/tree/master/KumoBSD)
