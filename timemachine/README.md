## Background
This is an idea which has been around for a while but I did not have time to dig
into it and see how it worked. Finally I had the determination to replace an 
Apple TimeCapsule with FreeBSD and ZFS. Well, it was more about the fact that I
moved and needed a backup for my MacBook Air. 

## Installation
That's right folks, step one.

### Packages
These are the things you will need to add in order to make your FreeBSD box look
like a TimeCapsule.
